\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.2}{\ignorespaces Four important length scales for fluidics and surface forces. \textbf {milli-}: Caenorhabditis elegans (\textit {c. elegans}) sample, approximately 1 mm in length. Surface tension and capillary forces become significant at this length scale. Fluid dynamics is described by the complete Navier-Stokes equations. \textbf {micro-}: HCT-116 (colorectal cancer) cells, approximately $\SI {10}{\mu m}$ in diameter. Surface effects become increasingly important. Gravity becomes increasingly negligible, and systems under small applied pressures are described by having low-Reynolds number. \textbf {nano-}: A protein. Fluidic systems are dominated by surface forces. Liquid within $\SI {1}{nm}$ of surfaces is entirely contained within the electrical double layer. Fluid is completely non-inertial. \textbf {sub nano-}: A water molecule. Mean-field approximations are no longer valid. Navier-Stokes breaks down. Physics is determined entirely by electrostatic and Van der Waals forces between individual atoms and molecules.\relax }}{11}{figure.caption.10}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.3}{\ignorespaces Scheme of the electrical double layer under the Gouy-Chapman and Stern model. There is an abundance of counterions near the pore surface and a reduced number of coions. At the bulk both ion species' concentrations are equal.\relax }}{18}{figure.caption.11}

The plot reveals a large super linear increase of total solution within the EDL as diameter decreases, starting at approximately $D\approx 10\lambda _{D}$.\relax }}{19}{figure.caption.12}
